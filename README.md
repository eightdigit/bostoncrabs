# The CRABS project is a FO4 mod intended to provide 
# the player multiple small bases across the Commonwealth. There
# will be no workbenches at the smaller CRAB sites, I may add one
# at the main site if I opt to go with a traditional player home
# inside the mod.

# CRAB Sites are intended to provide a small base of operations
# for the area in which they are located to act as a junk 
# collection point, workshop (types depending on location), and
# general all-purpose rest stop with safe shared storage.

# This mod is VERY much a WIP. I would not advise using it. I
# will very likely break it and your savegame along with it.
